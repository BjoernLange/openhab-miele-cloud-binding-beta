# Miele Cloud Binding

![Miele](doc/miele.png)

This binding integrates [Miele@home](https://www.miele.de/brand/smarthome-42801.htm) appliances via a cloud connection.
A Miele cloud account and a set of developer credentials is required to use the binding.
The latter can be requested from the [Miele Developer Portal](https://www.miele.com/f/com/en/register_api.aspx).

## Supported Things

Most Miele appliances that directly connect to the cloud via a Wi-Fi module are supported.
Appliances connecting to the XGW3000 gateway via ZigBee are also supported when registered with the cloud account.
However they might be better supported by the [gateway-based Miele binding](https://www.openhab.org/addons/bindings/miele/).
Depending on the age of your appliance the functionality of the binding might be limited.
Appliances from recent generations will support all functionality.

The following types of appliances are supported:

- Coffee Machine
- Dishwasher
- Dish Warmer
- Freezer
- Fridge
- Fridge-Freezer Combination
- Hob
- Hood
- Microwave Oven
- Oven
- Robotic Vacuum Cleaner
- Tumble Dryer
- Washer Dryer
- Washing Machine
- Wine Cabinet
- Wine Cabinet Freezer Combination

## Discovery

Please take the following steps prior to using the binding. Create a Miele cloud account in the Miele@mobile app for [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.miele.infocontrol&hl=en_US) or [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/miele-mobile/id930406907?l=en) (if not already done).
Afterwards, pair your appliances.
Once your appliances are set up, register at the [Miele Developer Portal](https://www.miele.com/f/com/en/register_api.aspx).
You will receive a pair of client ID and client secret which will be used to pair your Miele cloud account to the Miele cloud openHAB binding.
Keep these credentials to yourself and treat them like a password!
It may take some time until the registration e-mail arrives.

There is no auto discovery for the Miele cloud account.
The account is paired using OAuth2 with your Miele login and the developer credentials obtained from the [Miele Developer Portal](https://www.miele.com/f/com/en/register_api.aspx).
To pair the account go to the binding's configuration UI at `https://<your openHAB address>/mielecloud`.
For a standard openHABian Pi installation the address is [https://openhabianpi:8443/mielecloud](https://openhabianpi:8443/mielecloud).
Note that your browser will file a warning that the certificate is self-signed.
This is fine and you can safely continue.
It is also possible to use an unsecured connection for pairing but it is strongly recommended to use a secured connection because your credentials will otherwise be transferred without encryption over the local network.
For more information on this topic, see [Securing access to openHAB](https://www.openhab.org/docs/installation/security.html#encrypted-communication).
For a detailed walk through the account configuration, see [Account Configuration Example](#account-configuration-example).

Once a Miele account is paired, all supported appliances are automatically discovered as individual things and placed in the inbox.
They can then be paired with your favorite management UI, e.g. the PaperUI.
As an alternative, the binding configuration UI provides a things-file template per paired account that can be used to pair the appliances.

## Thing Configuration

A Miele cloud account needs to be configured to get access to your appliances.
After that appliances can be configured.

### Account Configuration

The Miele cloud account must be paired via the binding configuration UI before a bridge that relies on it can be configured in openHAB.
For details on the configuration UI see [Discovery](#discovery) and [Account Configuration Example](#account-configuration-example).
The account serves as a bridge for the things representing your appliances.
On success the configuration assistant will directly configure the account without requiring further actions.
As an alternative, it provides a things-file template.

The account has the following parameters:

| Name        | Type      | Description                                                                                                                                                | Notes                                |
| ----------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| locale      | mandatory | The locale to use for full text channels of things from this account. Possible values are `en`, `de`, `da`, `es`, `fr`, `it`, `nl`, `nb`. Default is `en`. | Prior to the 7th January 2021 `da`, `es`, `fr`, `it`, `nl` and `nb` will default to English. |

Example things-file:
```
Bridge mielecloud:account:home [ locale="en" ]
```

### Appliance Configuration

The binding configuration UI will show a things-file template containing things for all supported appliances from the paired account.
This can be used as a starting point for a custom things-file.
All Miele cloud appliance things have no configuration parameters.

Example things-file:
```
Bridge mielecloud:account:home [ locale="en" ] {
    Thing coffee_system 000703261234 "Coffee machine CVA7440" [ ]
    Thing hob 000160102345 "Cooktop KM7677" [ ]
    Thing washing_machine 000148503456 "Washing Machine WWV980" [ ]
    Thing oven 000137434567 "Oven" [ ]
    Thing fridge 007109235678 "Refrigerator K34483" [ ]
    Thing dishwasher 000159456789 "Dishwasher G5000" [ ]
    Thing fridge_freezer 711397890 "Fridge-freezer" [ ]
    Thing dryer 000091098901 "Dryer" [ ]
}
```

## Channels

The following table lists all available channels.
See the following chapters for detailed information about which appliance supports which channels.
Depending on the exact appliance configuration not all channels might be supported, e.g. a hob with four plates will only fill the channels for plates 1-4.

### Note on plate_is_present and plate_power_step channels

The `plate_x_is_present` channels show whether a plate is present on an appliance.
The plate numbers do not represent the physical layout of the plates on the appliance, but always start with the `plate_1_is_present` channel.
This means that a hob with two plates will have `plate_1_is_present` and `plate_2_is_present` active and all other `plate_x_is_present` channels inactive.

The `plate_x_power_step` channels show the current power step of the according plate.
**Please note that different hobs may use dynamic numbering for plates.**
Hobs that use dynamic numbering will use the first power step channel that is currently at a power step of zero when the plate is turned on.
Additionally, when a plate is turned off all other plates with higher numbers will decrease their number by one.
For example if plate 1, 2 and 3 are active and plate 1 is turned off then plate 2 will become plate 1, plate 3 will become plate 2 and plate 3 will have a power step of zero.
This behavior is a fixed part of the affected appliances and cannot be changed.

### Note on door_state channel

The `door_state` channel might not always provide a value matching the actual state.
For example, a washing machine will not provide a valid `door_state` when the appliance is turned off.
A valid door state can be expected when the appliance is in one of the following raw operation states, compare the `operation_state_raw` channel:

- `3`: Program selected
- `4`: Program selected, waiting to start
- `5`: Running
- `6`: Paused

## Account Configuration Example

The configuration UI is accessible at `https://<your openHAB address>/mielecloud`.
See [Discovery](#discovery) for a detailed description of how to open the configuration UI in a browser.

When first opening the configuration UI no account will be paired.

![Empty Account Overview](doc/account-overview-empty.png)

We strongly recommend to use a secure connection for pairing, details on this topic can also be found in the [Discovery](#discovery) section.
Click `Pair Account` to start the pairing process.
If not already done, go to the [Miele Developer Portal](https://www.miele.com/f/com/en/register_api.aspx), register there and wait for the confirmation e-mail.
Obtain your client ID and client secret according to the instructions presented there.
Once you obtained your client ID and client secret continue pairing by filling in your client ID, client secret and bridge ID.
You may choose any bridge ID you like as long as you only use letters, numbers, underscores and dashes.
The bridge ID entered here will become part of the thing UID of the paired account and cannot be changed later.
If you want to change the bridge ID you will need to remove the bridge and pair it again with the new bridge ID.

![Pair Account](doc/pair-account.png)

A click on `Pair Account` will take you to the Miele cloud service login form where you need to log in with the same account as you used for the Miele@mobile app.

![Miele Login Form](doc/miele-login.png)

When this is the first time you pair an account, you will need to allow openHAB to access your account.

When everything worked, you are presented with a page stating that pairing was successful.
Select the locale which should be used to display localized texts in openHAB channels.
Note that there is currently an issue with the endpoint of the Miele cloud service which is used by the binding that prevents the locale setting from functioning correctly.
This will be fixed in the future.
From here, you have two options:
Either let the binding automatically configure a bridge instance or copy the presented things-file template to a things file and return to the overview page.
We recommend the former for reasons outlined under [Account Configuration](#account-configuration).

![Pairing Successful](doc/pairing-success.png)

Once the bridge instance is `ONLINE`, you can either pair things for all appliances via your favorite management UI, e.g. the Paper UI, or use a things-file.
The account overview provides a things-file template that is shown when you expand the account.
This can serve as a starting point for your own things-file.

## Rule Ideas

Here are some ideas on what could be done with this binding. You have more ideas or even an example? Great! Feel free to contribute!
- Notify yourself of a finished dishwasher, tumble dryer, washer dryer or washing machine, e.g. by changing the lighting
- Control the supercooler / superfreezer of your freezer, fridge or fridge-freezer combination with a voice assistant
- Notify yourself when the oven has finished pre-heating
